Hi there! I am Akhil Bandarupalli, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Purdue University. I am advised by Prof. Aniket Kate and Prof. Saurabh Bagchi. 

### Research Interests
I design fault-tolerant distributed computing protocols for blockchains, privacy-preserving computation, and resource-constrained Cyber-Physical Systems. My research combines novel distributed computing techniques with cryptography to build protocols with provable security and efficiency. My current research focuses on computationally efficient distributed protocols for Multi-Party Computation, Asynchronous Random Beacons, and Convex Byzantine Agreement. I practically implement my research and aim to produce quality software artifacts that can be employed in real-world applications.

### Artifacts
I produced multiple software artifacts as part of my research. Each artifact is set up in a separate Github repository. 

1. The `hashrand-rs` repository implements HashRand, a computationally efficient asynchronous random beacon protocol (CCS'24). This repository also contains an implementation of the Dfinity-DVRF beacon protocol based on threshold BLS signatures. These protocols have been implemented in Rust. This artifact is also available on Zenodo. [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.11176836.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11176836)

2. The `delphi-rs` repository implements Delphi, a computationally efficient asynchronous convex agreement protocol (DSN'24). This repository also contains an implementation of the FIN Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS) protocol, and Abraham et al.'s Approximate Agreement protocol. These protocols have been implemented in Rust. This artifact is also available on Zenodo. [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.11061584.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11061584)

3. The `pqsmr-rs` repository implements PQ-Tusk (CCS'24), a Post-Quantum secure asynchronous State Machine Replication (SMR) protocol. This protocol uses Dilithium signatures for certificate generation. These protocols have been implemented in Rust. This artifact is also available on Zenodo.  [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.11176836.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11176836)

4. The `sensorbft-rs` repository implements SensorBFT (ICDCS'24), an efficient asynchronous approximate agreement protocol for target localization. This protocol has been implemented in Rust.

5. The `E2C-BLE` repository implements EESMR, an energy-efficient synchronous State Machine Replication (SMR) protocol. This artifact has been implemented in C++. This artifact uses libraries from `mbedos`, a lightweight OS for low-power embedded devices.
